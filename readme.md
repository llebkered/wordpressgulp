# Wordpress Theme Gulp Starter

v 1.1

20/2/2017

A very simple starter package for Gulp and a blank Wordpress theme. I usually use underscores as my Starter theme.

This version only compiles SASS into CSS.

There are other options in the Gulpfile to combine and minify SVG's but these have been commented out.

* [underscores.me](underscores.me)

## Instructions

1. Copy Gulpfile.js and package.json to the root of your theme.

2. Adjust Gulpfile  and package.json to suit your needs

3. Run *npm install* or *yarn*  to install the node packages.

4. Run *gulp sass* to compile the sass into css
